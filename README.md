Codes to generate the link adjacency matrix (LinkBoundary2.m) and to use the link adjacency matrix (LinkMatrix_Size400_ScarRad80_and_BorderRad100_Lam50_Np30000.mat)
and initial condition data (Shallow_TP06_Size400_D0_1_FromT6610ms_Upto7200ms.mat) to run the code for simulating the electrical activity during rapid pacing of a
2D left ventricular tissue with a fibrotic scar using the TNNP-TP06 model and MacCannell active fibroblast model. 
The tissue model parameters correspond to shallow restitution curve and the fibroblast resting membrane potential is set to -24.5 mV.
